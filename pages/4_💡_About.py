The reason why I developed this online application is because I enjoy researching various new LLMs, 
including open source and closed source online. However, after deploying the server, 
I often have to test it. I searched online for a long time but couldn't find a good one, 
so I wrote one myself with streamlit, you can play any API server that compatible with OpenAI API,
hoping to help friends with similar needs.
